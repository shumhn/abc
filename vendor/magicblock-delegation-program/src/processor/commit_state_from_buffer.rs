/// Commit a new state of a delegated Pda
///
/// It is identical to [crate::processor::process_commit_state] but it takes the new state
/// from a buffer account
///
/// Accounts:
///
/// 0: `[signer]`   the validator requesting the commit
/// 1: `[]`         the delegated account
/// 2: `[writable]` the PDA storing the new state temporarily
/// 3: `[writable]` the PDA storing the commit record
/// 4: `[]`         the delegation record
/// 5: `[writable]` the delegation metadata
/// 6: `[]`         the buffer account storing the data to be committed
/// 7: `[]`         the validator fees vault
/// 8: `[]`         the program config account
/// 9: `[]`         the system program
///
/// Requirements:
///
/// - delegation record is initialized
/// - delegation metadata is initialized
/// - validator fees vault is initialized
/// - program config is initialized
/// - commit state is uninitialized
/// - commit record is uninitialized
/// - delegated account holds at least the lamports indicated in the delegation record
/// - account was not committed at a later slot
///
/// Steps:
/// 1. Check that the pda is delegated
/// 2. Init a new PDA to store the new state
/// 3. Copy the new state to the new PDA
/// 4. Init a new PDA to store the record of the new state commitment
